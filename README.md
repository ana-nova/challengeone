- Practiced synchronizing local repositories with remote repositories (on GitHub), using `git push` to upload local changes and `git pull` to retrieve the latest updates from the remote repository.
- Explored Git branches, understanding how they allow for parallel development and feature isolation. Learned how to create and switch between branches using `git checkout` and `git branch`.
- Learned how to create **pull requests** on GitHub to propose changes, review code, and collaborate with team members.
- Understood how branches and pull requests facilitate collaboration, allowing multiple contributors to work on different features or fixes simultaneously, while maintaining a clean main branch.
